# RT-Playlist
This is a simple Node.js CLI app built to return a list of all related videos on the Rooster Teeth website.  See **NOTES** below for important information.

### Installation
As it is built with Node.js, installation is managed through NPM and dependencies are controlled through attached package.json file.  To install dependencies:

`npm install `


### Running App

'node rt.js'


### NOTES
Since this has the ability to quickly crawl multiple pages on the roosterteeth website, be aware of bandwidth constraints and be nice to RT.  With tweaks, this could be used for nefarious reasons...don't be that person >_>
